Hi, I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves turning ideas into real products.  
I enjoy building everything from quick prototypes to full-scale applications, always focusing on clean, reliable solutions.  

I mostly work with **JavaScript/TypeScript** using **React, React Native, Vue, and Nuxt**.  
I’m also familiar with **PHP and Laravel** on the backend, and I use **TailwindCSS, Material UI, Ant Design, Semantic UI, and Blueprint** to create clean and responsive UIs.  

For mobile, I build apps with **React Native, Expo, Styled Components, and Lottie animations**, bringing smooth design and strong performance together.  

## 🚀 Achievements
- ⭐ Built and contributed to many **web and cross-platform mobile applications**.  
- 💡 Helped improve **user experience and business workflows** through well-designed solutions.  
- 🔧 Always learning and experimenting with new tools to deliver better results.
